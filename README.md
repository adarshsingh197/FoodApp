Improvements to Make

Not responsive for mobile phones.
Cart data is not stored anywhere; should be in local storage for non-logged-in users to avoid losing data on page refresh.
User names are not displayed in the profile immediately upon signing up; requires a refresh.
Design improvements needed, including user address and payment details.
Add a feature to search for different cities; currently works only for Prayagraj.
